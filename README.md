# Backgammon

**Backgammon Project**
The Backgammon project is a C++ language project using a GUI handling library called "ncurses." It is an implementation of the popular board game "backgammon". It was created for a college project. The main objectives and challenges of this project:

  **->** Using the "ncurses" library to handle the GUI. The difficulty with this library was in two aspects - first, it was new to me, so I had to learn the basics of this library in a short period of time. Secondly, it was a new experience - working not in the terminal but in the "window" of the program. This required a different approach to at least, debugging the program. 
  
  **->** Implementation of the game logic. This one was quite a problem, as the Backgammon game is quite a confusing game in itself. This part of the project definitely required the most time
  
  **->** Storage of saved game state
  
  **->** Two-player game
  
The project was written in PyCharm environment on Linux. In order to run the program, you need to install the ncurses library (Mac / Linux).
